# Project Bin Ronin

Some notes on a game similar in structure & scope to Mon Bazou, with handling and physics closer to a GTA.

- Mostly third-person view
- Player lives in a small village, and sleeps in their car at the start of the game
- Various characters around the village can be helped in different ways, and can provide garages/services/accommodations etc in return

## Setting

The UK government has defunded almost every public service, including the binmen. You (the player) are a wandering binman without a bin lorry or a team, doing odd jobs to make ends meet.

At the start of the game, you are living in your car in a village. You can use your car to go around cleaning the town and picking up litter, which will earn the respect and admiration of the other villagers.

You can visit the Bakery to get baked goods (for free) which replenish your Food meter.
If your Food meter drops to 0, or if you get hit by a fast-moving car, you will wake up at the Hospital.

You can talk to the villagers, and they will tell you about litter that they've seen recently that needs cleaning up. You can pick up litter, put it in your car, and take it to The Dump to dispose of it.

# Bin Day
Some notes on a game similar in structure & scope to Mon Bazou, with handling and physics closer to a GTA.
- Mostly third-person view
- Player lives in a small village, and sleeps in their car at the start of the game
- Various characters around the village can be helped in different ways, and can provide garages/services/accommodations etc in return

## Setting
The UK government has defunded almost every public service, including the binmen. You (the player) are a wandering binman without a bin lorry or a team, doing odd jobs to make ends meet.
At the start of the game, you are living in your car in a village. You can use your car to go around cleaning the town and picking up litter, which will earn the respect and admiration of the other villagers.
You can visit the Bakery to get baked goods (for free) which replenish your Food meter.
If your Food meter drops to 0, or if you get hit by a fast-moving car, you will wake up at the Hospital.
You can talk to the villagers, and they will tell you about litter that they've seen recently that needs cleaning up. You can pick up litter, put it in your car, and take it to The Dump to dispose of it.

## Characters
### The Player
A former binman, who falls asleep in his car and washes up on the shore of the island. Using his binbag handling skills and a variety of vehicles, he helps clean up the island and revive Bin Day as a concept.
### Tipman
Friendly guy who lives at the dump. He'll sometimes find useful things for the player, like vehicle parts and home decorations. Occasionally dies and gets carried away by gulls in a funeral ceremony, before a new Tipman emerges from the dump.
### Kay
Sole employee of the local bakery, which is owned by an app or an AI or something. Amateur economist who's unknowingly rewritten Marx's critique of capital by working things out from first principles.
### Greg
Has a work-from-home job training an AI to tell people to piss off, by sitting at his desk telling his computer to piss off in different ways.

## Gameplay
Rubbish will be produced in different ways around the island, and needs to be collected and taken to the dump. NPCs will pick up litter and take binbags to the dump, but this slows their progress on whatever they're working on. By driving round the island cleaning up rubbish, the player can free up NPCs to work on various improvements around the island, some of which might provide the player with new services, equipment and vehicles.

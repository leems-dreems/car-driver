# Bin Day

Some notes on a game similar in structure & scope to Mon Bazou, with handling and physics closer to a GTA.
- Mostly third-person view
- Player lives in a small village, and sleeps in their car at the start of the game
- Various characters around the village can be helped in different ways, and can provide garages/services/accommodations etc in return

## Setting

The UK government has defunded almost every public service, including the binmen. You (the player) are a wandering binman without a bin lorry or a team, doing odd jobs to make ends meet.
At the start of the game, you are living in your car in a village. You can use your car to go around cleaning the town and picking up litter, which will earn the respect and admiration of the other villagers.
You can visit the Bakery to get baked goods (for free) which replenish your Food meter.
If your Food meter drops to 0, or if you get hit by a fast-moving car, you will wake up at the Hospital.
You can talk to the villagers, and they will tell you about litter that they've seen recently that needs cleaning up. You can pick up litter, put it in your car, and take it to The Dump to dispose of it.

## Characters

### The Player
A former binman, trapped on the island and wanted for Bin Taking.
### Tipman
Friendly guy who lives at the dump. He'll sometimes find useful things for the player, like vehicle parts and home decorations. Occasionally dies and gets carried away by gulls in a funeral ceremony, before a new Tipman emerges from the dump.
**Routine:**
- Spends all day walking/teleporting around the dump
### Kay
Sole employee of the local bakery, which is owned by an app or an AI or something. Amateur economist who's unknowingly rewritten Marx's critique of capital by working things out from first principles.
**Routine:**
- Monday-Friday, 7:00-4:30, goes to the bakery and refills various machines, picks up litter, empties bins and puts the bags into a dumpster outside.
- Tuesday, sometime during the workday, picks up a big can of mustard from Penny's Paints & Sauces.
- Thursday, sometime during the workday, puts the binbags into a self-driving truck which takes them to the dump.
### Greg
Has a work-from-home job training an AI to tell people to piss off, by sitting at his desk telling his computer to piss off in different ways.
### Penny
Mixes paint, can produce different colour cans of paint that the player can use to decorate things. Has a repeat job for the player to put cans of paint in their car and do specific stunts, so as to mix the paint perfectly.

## Gameplay

The player can offer to do jobs for NPCs around the map. Depending on the job, it may need to be repeated daily/weekly/monthly, and may be limited to certain days or times of day (eg. need to pick an item up from somewhere that isn't open all the time).


### Trash
Trash will be produced in different ways around the island, and needs to be collected and taken to the dump.
Sources of trash include:
- Trash produced when player eats food or consumes items
- Pieces falling off moving vehicles
- Gulls can rip open binbags and spread trash about
- Trash dropped from overhead dumping flights
Handling trash causes the player's Stink Level to rise, depending on what kind of trash it is. Vehicles can also gain Stink if stinky items are inside.

### Planner mechanic
The player has a planner they can open, which shows a list of uncompleted jobs. These jobs can be assigned to specific days & times in the planner. To accept some jobs the player needs to negotiate a set time with the NPC, and the job will automatically be added to the planner.

## Plot

The United Kingdom, 202X. All public services have been outlawed as a cost-saving measure, even the binmen.

The player is in a car chase with the police, wanted for the crime of taking the bins. As the player drives across the only bridge to the island the game takes place on, the bridge collapses due to disrepair, trapping the player on the island.

The player then has free reign to explore the island, and talk to the characters who live there. Some characters need to transport things from one place to another, and the player can offer to do do this job for them.
Most characters also have binbags they have to take to the dump on a regular basis.

Each character has something they do in their free time, and completing jobs for them (and taking their bins) will allow them to do more of this thing. Some NPCs will do things to improve the island & introduce new features/buildings/areas, some will make cosmetic changes to the island, and some will just goof off and have fun.

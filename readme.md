# Extreme Commuter

## Gameplay structure
This is a game about navigating a chaotic city to get to work. Every day the player is assigned a new job, and must get to their place of work without getting injured and sent to the hospital.
Some jobs require the player to pick up certain items, drive certain vehicles, or pick up certain NPCs before heading to work.
Upon arriving at work, time advances and the player is told that they have been fired. This happens irrespectively of how well the player did, or how quickly they got to work. They will be find or be assigned a new job the next day.
After the work day is over and the player has been fired, they are in free-roam mode until going home to sleep.

## Setting and tone
This game is set in a city that's going through a libertarian experiment where almost all regulations have been done away with, including speed limits, workers' rights, and building codes.
The police still exist, but function more like gangs tied to specific areas of the map than a cohesive force.
The city still has a surprisingly functional healthcare system, which means the player will respawn at a hospital after taking enough damage.
Tonally, I think the game should be somewhere between the slapstick absurdism of Tiny Terry's Turbo Trip, and the bleak dystopia of Cruelty Squad.

### The mayor loves technology
The new mayor of the city (Adam Eric?) loves two things: tech gizmos and small businesses. Under his mayorship the city has introduced self-driving taxis, raised speed limits, and created more opportunities for jumps and stunts. Businesses can fire workers at any time and for any reason, and shops are guarded by robots who will pursue thieves and vandals. The police, having had their jobs automated, have descended into inter-departmental squabbling as they divide the city up amongst themselves. As a result, different departments (e.g. traffic cops, homicide, SWAT etc) police different areas of the map, and may sometimes engage in turf wars.
